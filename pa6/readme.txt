The class defined by the files are:
User- each individual user
Network- the graph of users as vertices and friends as edges

The file social_network.cpp has a main method that calls creates a new network object calls it's read() method,
taking the input file name as an argument from the command line.

Note: The program assumes that all users have a first and last name, separated by a space.

The friend suggestions method generates a vector of all users that are at a relational distance of two from the user.
The method then assigns a score to each of these strong candidates based on the number of mutual friends they have, and displays the highest scorers.

The smallest set of users needed for a transitive connection to all users was generated by a 'greedy' algorithm that started with the user who had the most friends.
The method proceeded with the user with the next user who had the most friends not already covered, adding users until there was a path to every one.
